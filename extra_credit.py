#   * takes a string representing a Yupik word
#   * if the word conforms to Yupik spelling, 
#     the function should return the corresponding string in IPA, with syllable boundaries marked with a period (".")
#   * otherwise the function should return the original string
#
# 
# When this file is executed, it should:
#     * accept text from standard input
