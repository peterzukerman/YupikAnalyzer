# Write a Python program that accepts text from standard input,
# lowercases it, and tokenizes it into Yupik graphemes, applies the automatic devoicing rules, 
# then converts each grapheme into the appropriate IPA symbol,
# and then prints the corresponding output (formatted as words, not lists of graphemes).
#
# You will need to import tokenize from d.py
# You will need to import undouble from c.py
#
# Your output should not contain any apostrophes.
