# PART B (10%)
#
# Implement the graphemes2ipa function.
# It should accept a list of graphemes, and return a list of IPA symbols.
# If any grapheme is not a Yupik letter, it should be passed through unchanged.
#
# When this file is executed, it should:
#     * accepts text from standard input,
#     * lowercases it, 
#     * tokenizes it into Yupik graphemes using your tokenize function from d.py (with keep_apostrophes=False),
#     * applies the automatic devoicing rules using your apply_devoicing function from c.py, 
#     * converts each grapheme into the appropriate IPA symbol using your graphemes2ipa function,
#     * and then print the corresponding output (formatted as words, not lists of graphemes).
#
# You will need to import tokenize from d.py
# You will need to import apply_devoicing from c.py
#
# Your output should not contain any apostrophes.
